 *
 * That breadth is the point when the portfolio's shape changes for everyone: a
 * schema change, a layout change, a credit-role change. It is the wrong tool
 * for editing one artist, and it used to be the only tool, which is why a
 * single admin save rebuilt the entire artist catalogue. Prefer
